# Breast-cancer-detection

We will look at application of Machine Learning algorithms to one of the data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to classify whether a set of readings from clinical reports are positive for breast cancer or not.
This is one of the easier datasets to process since all the features have integer values.
We will use the scikit-learn algorithms to process this dataset.

We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set.
